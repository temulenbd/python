    "If you try to use a local variable in a function before you assign a value to it, as in the following program, Python will give you an error. This error happens because Python sees that there is an assignment statement for 'eggs' in the 'spam()' function and, therefore, considers 'eggs' to be local. But because 'print(eggs)' is executed before 'eggs' is assigned anything, the local variable eggs doesn’t exist. Python will not fall back to using the global 'eggs' variable."

When you think about functions in this high-level way, it’s common to say that you’re treating a function as a “black box.” This idea is fundamental to modern programming. "
